Most people today have come to consume the Internet on their mobile devices. Due to this, there has been an explosion of “apps” that run natively on popular platforms (iOS, Android) that make the experience smoother and richer than just a simple HTML+JS single-page app (SPA). This new reality brings a huge cost to companies, which now have to maintain 3 separate codebases for their apps (one for iOS, one for Android, and one for the web). To address this issue cross-platform app development frameworks have been created that automatically translate code written in a common popular programming language (e.g., JavaScript/TypeScript) into a native version for each platform.

This assessment simulates a real-world scenario of implementing the “Rewards” screen for an app that shows users the rewards they earned for using the app (inflows), where they spent their rewards (outflows), as well as their total account balance.
